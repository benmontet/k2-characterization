	Abstract = {Precise and accurate parameters for late-type (late K and M) dwarf stars are important for proper characterization of any planets they host, but studies have been hampered by these stars' complex spectra and dissimilarity to the Sun. We exploited a calibrated method of spectroscopic effective temperature ($T_{\rm{eff}}$) estimation and the Stefan-Boltzmann law to determine radii with an accuracy of 2-5% and expand the sample to 161 nearby K7-M7 dwarf stars covering a wider range of $T_{\rm{eff}}$ and metallicity. We developed improved relations between $T_{\rm{eff}}$, radius, and luminosity, as well as between $T_{\rm{eff}}$ and color. Our $T_{\rm{eff}}$-radius relation depends strongly on [Fe/H], as predicted by theory. We derived a relation between absolute $K_S$ magnitude and radius that is accurate to better than 3%. We derived bolometric correction to the $VR_CI_CgrizJHK_S$ and Gaia passbands as a function of color, accurate to 1-3%. We confronted the reliability of predictions from Dartmouth stellar evolution models using a Monte Carlo Markov Chain (MCMC) to find the values of unobservable model parameters (mass, age) that best reproduce the observed effective temperature and bolometric flux while satisfying constraints on distance and metallicity as Bayesian priors. Theoretical masses were related to $K_S$-band luminosities and compared to a relation developed from astrometric binaries. Model masses agree well with the empirical relation, with a notable offset at $M_\star$>0.55$M_\odot$. The best-agreement models over-predict stellar $T_{\rm{eff}}$s by an average of 2.2% and under-predict stellar radii by 4.6%, similar to differences with values from low-mass eclipsing binaries. These differences are not correlated with metallicity, mass, or activity, suggesting issues with the underlying model assumptions e.g., opacities, helium mass fraction, or convective mixing length.},

	Abstract = {Knowledge of late K and M dwarf metallicities can be used to guide planet searches and constrain planet formation models. However, the determination of metallicities of late-type stars is difficult because visible wavelength spectra of their cool atmospheres contain many overlapping absorption lines, preventing the measurement of equivalent widths. We present new methods, and improved calibrations of existing methods, to determine metallicities of late K and M dwarfs from moderate resolution (1300 < R < 2000) visible and infrared spectra. We select a sample of 112 wide binary systems that contain a late-type companion to a solar-type primary star. Our sample includes 62 primary stars with previously published metallicities, as well as 50 stars with metallicities determined from our own observations. We use our sample to empirically determine which features in the spectrum of the companion are best correlated with the metallicity of the primary. We find sime120 features in K and M dwarf spectra that are useful for predicting metallicity. We derive metallicity calibrations for different wavelength ranges, and show that it is possible to get metallicities reliable to <0.10 dex using either visible, J-, H-, or K-band spectra. We find that the most accurate metallicities derived from visible spectra requires the use of different calibrations for early-type (K5.5-M2) and late-type (M2-M6) dwarfs. Our calibrations are applicable to dwarfs with metallicities of --1.04 < [Fe/H] <+0.56 and spectral types from K7 to M5. Lastly, we use our sample of wide binaries to test and refine existing calibrations to determine M dwarf metallicities. We find that the zeta parameter, which measures the ratio of TiO can CaH bands, is correlated with [Fe/H] for super-solar metallicities, and zeta does not always correctly identify metal-poor M dwarfs. We also find that existing calibrations in the K and H bands are quite reliable for stars with [Fe/H] >--0.5, but are less useful for more metal-poor stars.},

	Abstract = {We present the design, construction, and performance of SpeX, a medium-resolution 0.8-5.5 mum cryogenic spectrograph and imager, now in operation at the 3.0 m NASA Infrared Telescope Facility (IRTF) on Mauna Kea. The design uses prism cross-dispersers and gratings to provide resolving powers up to R~2000 simultaneously across 0.8-2.4, 1.9-4.2, or 2.4-5.5 mum, with a 15" long slit. A high-throughput low-resolution R~200 prism mode is also provided for faint-object and occultation spectroscopy. Single-order 60" long-slit modes with resolving powers up to R~2000 are available for extended objects. The spectrograph employs an Aladdin 3 1024×1024 InSb array and uses narrow slits and a spatial scale of 0.15" pixel-1 for optimum sensitivity on point sources. An autonomous infrared slit viewer is used for object acquisition, infrared guiding, and scientific imaging in the wavelength range 0.8-5.5 mum. The imager employs an Aladdin 2 512×512 InSb array that covers a 60''×60'' field of view at 0.12" pixel-1. SpeX was successfully commissioned on IRTF during 2000 May, June, and July. Astronomical observations are presented to illustrate performance.},

	Abstract = {We describe an IDL-based package for the reduction of spectral data obtained with SpeX, a medium-resolution, 0.8-5.5 mum cross-dispersed spectrograph and imager for the NASA Infrared Telescope Facility. The package, called Spextool, carries out all the procedures necessary to produce fully reduced spectra including preparation of calibration frames, processing and extraction of spectra from science frames, wavelength calibration of spectra, and flux calibration of spectra. The package incorporates an ``optimal extraction'' algorithm for point-source data and also generates realistic error arrays associated with the extracted spectra. Because it is fairly quick and easy to use, requiring minimal user interaction, Spextool can be run by observers at the telescope to estimate the signal-to-noise ratio of their data. We describe the procedures incorporated into Spextool and show examples of extracted spectra.},

The method makes use of a spectrum of an A0 V star, observed near in time and close in air mass to the target object, and a high-resolution model of Vega, to construct a telluric correction spectrum that is free of stellar absorption features. The technique was designed specifically to perform telluric corrections on spectra obtained with SpeX, a 0.8-5.5 mum medium-resolution cross-dispersed spectrograph at the NASA Infrared Telescope Facility, and uses the fact that for medium resolutions there exist spectral regions uncontaminated by atmospheric absorption lines. However, it is also applicable (in a somewhat modified form) to spectra obtained with other near-infrared spectrographs. An IDL-based code that carries out the procedures is available for downloading via the World Wide Web.

	Abstract = {We report Nearby Supernova Factory observations of SN 2005gj, the second confirmed case of a ``hybrid'' Type Ia/IIn supernova, which we interpret as the explosion of a white dwarf interacting with a circumstellar medium. Our early-phase photometry of SN 2005gj shows that the interaction is much stronger than for the prototype, SN 2002ic. Our first spectrum shows a hot continuum with broad and narrow Halpha emission. Later spectra, spanning over 4 months from outburst, show clear Type Ia features combined with broad and narrow Hgamma, Hbeta, Halpha, and He I lambdalambda5876, 7065 in emission. At higher resolution, P Cygni profiles are apparent. Surprisingly, we also observe an inverted P Cygni profile for [O III] lambda5007. We find that the light curve and measured velocity of the unshocked circumstellar material imply mass loss as recently as 8 years ago. The early light curve is well described by a flat radial density profile for the circumstellar material. However, our decomposition of the spectra into Type Ia and shock emission components allows for little obscuration of the supernova, suggesting an aspherical or clumpy distribution for the circumstellar material. We suggest that the emission-line velocity profiles arise from electron scattering rather than the kinematics of the shock. This is supported by the inferred high densities and the lack of evidence for evolution in the line widths. Ground- and space-based photometry and Keck spectroscopy of the host galaxy are used to ascertain that the host galaxy has low metallicity (Z/Zsolar<0.3 95% confidence) and that this galaxy is undergoing a significant star formation event that began roughly 200+/-70 Myr ago. We discuss the implications of these observations for progenitor models and cosmology using Type Ia supernovae.},

	Abstract = {SNIFS is an integral field spectrograph devoted to the observation of supernovae. This instrument is today in the manufacturing phase and should be able to observe supernovae at the end of this year (2003) on the 2.2m telescope of University Hawaii. The concept of SNIFS is to split the 6" x 6" field of view into 225 samples of 0.4" x 0.4" through a microlens array. Then the spectral decomposition of each sample is imaged on a 2k x 4k CCD. In order to cover all the large spectral range with a high resolution, the spectrograph is composed of two modules, one for the blue wavelengths (320 nm to 560nm)with a resolution around 1000 at 430 nm and one for the red wavelengths (520 nm to 1 µm) with a resolution around 1300 at 760 nm. First we will present the optical design and detail the function of each optical component. Then the mechanical design will be shown with some maps of the structure. Finally the first pictures taken during the alignments will be displayed.},
