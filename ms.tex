\section{Introduction}


\section{Stellar Properties}
\subsection{Photometry}

With the exception of one star in our sample (EPIC 201912552), we do not have
spectroscopic data with which to characterize the stellar properties. 
Instead, we rely on photometry.
For each system, we query the VizieR database of astronomical catalogues
\citep{Ochseinbein00}. 
We record the $B$, $V$, $g'$, $r'$, and $i'$ magnitudes and their
uncertainties from the AAVSO Photometric all-sky survey (APASS) DR6 
\btmtodo{Cite: Who?}, as reported in the UCAC4 Catalogue \citep{Zacharias12}.
We also record the $J$, $H$, and $K$ magnitudes and their uncertainties 
as found in the 2MASS All-Sky Catalog of Point Sources \citep{Cutri03}
and the four WISE magnitudes and uncertainties from the ALLWise Data
Release \citep{Cutri13}.
For all except two of our targets, the $W4$ band is only an upper limit.
These data are reported in Table \ref{Tab:Photometry}.

\btmtodo{Make this table!}

\subsection{Stellar Models}
To convert the observed photometric data into physical properties for each
star, we employ the use of stellar models. 
We first download the isochrone grids from the 2012 updated photometric
systems for the relevant bandpasses from the Dartmouth Stellar Evolution
Database \citep{Dotter08}. 
We then interpolate the isochrones onto a grid uniformly spaced in
stellar mass (from 0.20 to 2.0 \msun), metallicity (from \feh$=-1.5$ to 
\feh$=+0.5$), age (from 1.0 to 14.0 Gyr), and log distance (from 10 pc to 
1000 pc). 
In our interpolation, we assume \afe$=0.0$ and $Y=0.2741$, the solar value.
We then compare the expected apparent magnitudes to our observed photometry
to measure the likelihood of each grid point.
For each parameter, we then marginalize our likelihood over all other 
parameters in order to estimate the value of the physical properties
for each star.

Such a scheme enables us to infer the statistical uncertainties on the
mass, radius, and effective temperature.
However, we are subject to biases induced by systematics in the models themselves.
There is some evidence that the Dartmouth models may underpredict 
radii by $\sim 15\%$ when compared to other methods \citep{Newton15,
Montet15}. 
Such an effect may be the result of the Dartmouth model reliance on BT-Settl
atmospheres, which have been shown to predict near-IR colors that are too blue
\citep{Thompson14}.
We find that by measuring stellar parameters without any WISE data (that is, using
only $BVgriJHK$), we largely reproduce the same effective temperatures as when
the WISE data is included. 
However, at the low-mass end including the WISE data systematically increases the 
measured radius and increases \logg, as shown in \btmtodo{Figure}.
Suggestively, spectroscopic stellar parameters of EPIC 201912552 
(\textsection\ref{Spexobs}) suggest the derived photometric properties better 
represent the true physical parameters when the WISE data is included.

\subsection{SpeX Spectroscopy}
\label{Spexobs}


A near-infrared spectrum of EPIC 201912552 was obtained using the updated SpeX 
(uSpeX) spectrograph \citep{Rayner03} on the NASA Infrared Telescope Facility 
(IRTF) on January 29 2015 (UT). 
SpeX observations were taking using the short cross-dispersed mode and the
0.3$\times15\arcsec$ slit, which provides simultaneous coverage from 0.7 
to 2.5$\mu$m at $R\simeq2000$. 
The target was observed at two positions along the slit to subsequently subtract 
the sky background. Eight spectra were taking following this pattern, which provided 
a final S/N of $>150$ per resolving element. 
The spectrum was flat fielded, extracted, wavelength calibrated, and stacked 
using the \textit{SpeXTool} package \citep{Cushing04}. 
An A0V-type star was observed immediately after 
the target, which was used to create a telluric correction using the 
\textit{xtellcor} package \citep{Vacca03}.

An optical spectrum was obtained using the SuperNova Integral Field Spectrograph
\citep[SNIFS,][]{Aldering02,Lantz04} on the University of Hawai'i 
2.2m telescope on the night of January 30 2015. 
SNIFS provides simultaneous coverage from 3200\AA--9700\,AA\ at a resolution 
of $\simeq1000$. Final S/N of the spectrum was $>100$ pre resolving element 
in the red ($\sim6000$\AA). 
Details of the SNIFS reduction, including dark, bias, and flat-field corrections,
cleaning the data of bad pixels and cosmic rays, and extraction of the 
one-dimensional spectrum are described in \citet{Bacon01} and 
\citet{Aldering06}. 
Flux calibration was performed using a separate pipeline described in \citet{Mann15}. 

\teff\ was calculated by comparing our optical spectra with the CFIST
suite\footnote{http://phoenix.ens-lyon.fr/Grids/BT-Settl/CIFIST2011/} of the BT-SETTL
version of the PHOENIX atmosphere models \citep{Allard13}, which gave a temperature
of 3503 $\pm$ 60\,K. 
More details of this procedure are given in \citet{Mann14} and
\citet{Gaidos14}. 
This method was used because it is known to accurately reproduce empirical 
\teff\ values from long-baseline optical interferometry \citet{Boyajian12}. 

Metallcity was determined using the procedures from \citet{Mann13a}, in which the
authors provide empirical relations between atomic features and M dwarf
metallicity, calibrated using wide binaries. 
We adopted the weighted mean of the $H-$ and $K-$band calibrations, 
which yielded a metallicity of 0.09$\pm$0.09.

We combined the derived \teff\ and [Fe/H] values with the empirical 
\teff-[Fe/H]-$R_*$ relation from \citet{Mann15} to compute a radius. 
Accounting for measurement and calibration errors in [Fe/H] and \teff\ we calculated 
a radius 0.394$\pm0.038R_\odot$. 
We use these parameters instead of the derived photometric properties for this target.

\section{Planet Properties}

This is Dan?

\section{False Positive Analysis}
\subsection{Adaptive Optics Imaging}

This is Brendan.

\subsection{Known Background Stars}
The P3K AO system has a field of view of $3.84 \times 3.84$ arcseconds.
\btmtodo{Check with Brendan to make sure he used this mode}.
Each \KT\ pixel is a square of $3.98 \times 3.98$ arcseconds. 
A background eclipsing binary within a few \KT\ pixels of our target 
stars could mimic a transit signal while evading detection by P3K.
Such wide eclipsing binaries should appear in seeing-limited ground-based
surveys.

To investigate the possibility that such wide companions exist,
we query the ninth data release of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey 
\citep[SDSS DR9,][]{Ahn12}. 
For each target, we return
all stars within 12\arcsec with $\Delta r < 8$ relative to each object
of interest.
Of the 31 stars in our sample, four have such a companion.
Unlike the original \kep\ field, the field for \KT\ Campaign 1 is 
well out of the galactic plane, so the rate of giant, distanct background
stars is significantly lower.
We include a list of these potential contaminants as Table 
\ref{Table:BGstars}.

%Table:BGstars
% Primary    RA Dec Separation DeltaR         MaxDepth
% 201295312  &  &   &          & 7.10 \pm 0.10 & 0.75
% 201465501  &  &   &          & 7.90 \pm 0.25 & 0.36
% 201546283  &  &   &          & 5.87 \pm 0.06 & 2.31
% 201779067  &  &   &          & 4.21 \pm 0.03 & 10.56

In Table \ref{Table:BGstars}, the ``maximum depth'' column represents
the maximum observed ``transit'' depth if the transit were actually caused
by a total eclipse of the hypothetical background binary system, inducing
a 50\% flux decrement in the background star's apparent brightness.

For EPIC 201465501 and 201779067, the observed transit depth is 
larger than each of these values, so we reject the possibility that
these events could be the eclipses of the background binaries detected
here. 

For EPIC 201546283, the observed transit depth is nearly identical to 
the maximum false positive depth. 
The photometry for this potential contaminant is consistent with that
of an M3V star; for this object to cause the observed eclipse it must
be a total eclipse of two M3V stars. 
However, in that case, the observed event would be exactly V-shaped,
with second and third contact occurring simultaneously. 
Since the transit is not V-shaped, it must be the result of
a relatively small body passing in front of a relatively large body. 
Therefore, it cannot be caused by this observed background dwarf star.

For EPIC 201295312, the transit depth is significantly shallower than
the maximum false positive depth, so we cannot immediately
reject the hypothesis that the transit is actually a false positive 
induced by a background eclipsing binary. \anytodo{Can we place limits
on this possibility from the lack of a centroid shift?}

SDSS is 95\% complete at $r=22.2$ and the telescope has a point
spread function of $1\farcs4$. In all cases except the four above, we 
treat the SDSS data as providing a contrast curve at wide separations
down to a limiting magnitude of $r=22.2$.

\subsection{Archival Imaging}

This is Ben.


\subsection{TRES Radial Velocities}

We observed EPIC 201912552 on (all UT) February 04 2015, February 24 2015,
and February \btmtodo{XX} 2015 with the Tillinghast Reflector Echelle
Spectrograph (TRES) on the 1.5 m Tillinghast Reflector at the Fred L.
Whipple Observatory. 
The spectra were taken with a resolving power of $R=44,000$ and 
integration times ranging from 2800 to 3600 seconds, resulting in 
signal-to-noise ratios between 17 and 29 per resolution element.

\anytodo{This will be text from DaveL and/or Allyson Bieryla.}

The observed radial velocities are included in Table \ref{Tab:RVs}.

\section{Results and Discussion}

Something about Multis and TTVs will go in here.

\anytodo{We should have a figure of many subplots, of phase-folded
transits for all the confirmed planets. 
To ease Dan's mind, we will say that they are the product of 
some fidicual transit model and are only presented here for illustrative
purposes.}
