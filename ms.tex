\section{Introduction}


\section{Stellar Properties}
\subsection{Photometry}

With the exception of one star in our sample (EPIC 201912552), we do not have
spectroscopic data with which to characterize the stellar properties. 
Instead, we rely on photometry.
For each system, we query the VizieR database of astronomical catalogues
\citep{Ochseinbein00}. 
We record the $B$, $V$, $g'$, $r'$, and $i'$ magnitudes and their
uncertainties from the AAVSO Photometric all-sky survey (APASS) DR6 
\btmtodo{Cite: Who?}, as reported in the UCAC4 Catalogue \citep{Zacharias12}.
We also record the $J$, $H$, and $K$ magnitudes and their uncertainties 
as found in the 2MASS All-Sky Catalog of Point Sources \citep{Cutri03}
and the four WISE magnitudes and uncertainties from the ALLWise Data
Release \citep{Cutri13}.
For all except two of our targets, the $W4$ band is only an upper limit.
These data are reported in Table \ref{Tab:Photometry}.

\btmtodo{Make this table!}

\subsection{Stellar Models}
To convert the observed photometric data into physical properties for each
star, we employ the use of two stellar models. 
We first download the isochrone grids from the 2012 updated photometric
systems for the relevant bandpasses from the Dartmouth Stellar Evolution
Database \citep{Dotter08}. 
We then interpolate the isochrones onto a grid uniformly spaced in
stellar mass (from 0.20 to 2.0 \msun), metallicity (from \feh$=-1.5$ to 
\feh$=+0.5$), age (from 1.0 to 14.0 Gyr), and log distance (from 10 pc to 
1000 pc). 
In our interpolation, we assume \afe$=0.0$ and $Y=0.2741$, the solar value.
We then compare the expected apparent magnitudes to our observed photometry
to measure the likelihood of each grid point.
For each parameter, we then marginalize our likelihood over all other 
parameters in order to estimate the value of the physical properties
for each star.

Such a scheme enables us to infer the statistical uncertainties on the
mass, radius, and effective temperature.
However, we remain ignorant of any systematic uncertainties that may be
induced by our reliance on the Dartmouth models.
To this end, we repeat this procedure with the Padova database of stellar
evolutionary tracks and isochrones \btmtodo{Cite: Who? Claims to be in
file headers}. 
Comparing two models will not help us understand any systematic errors
of the two are biased in the same way, but in general it will allow us
to calculate a more accurate assessment of our true uncertainties than 
relying on one model alone.


The Padova models consistently produce radii which are \btmtodo{VALUE\%} 
larger than those predicted by the Dartmouth models. 
The Dartmouth models have been found to underestimate the radii of 
K and M dwarfs by about 15\% when compared to other methods
\citep{Newton15, Montet15}.
