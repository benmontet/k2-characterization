False positive probability (FPP) models corresponding
to calculations in the K2 Campaign-1 planet characterization
paper of Montet, Morton, Foreman-Mackey et al. (2015).

These calculations were performed using the ``vespa`` code;
see the documentation at http://vespa.readthedocs.org.

All the information that was used for the population modeling
is in the ``fpp.ini`` file in each folder; the calculations were
made using the ``calcfpp`` script described in the ``vespa`` docs,
with the folder names as the sole argument to the script.

If you obtain the VESPA code, you should be able to reproduce
the results presented in the paper (modulo some random fluctuations).
In addition, you can change the inputs and see what happens (e.g. 
remove contrast curves, change the photometric uncertainties, etc. etc.).
